In this notebook, I have classified the News articles into four categories:- "World News", "Sports News", "Business News" and "Science-Tech News". 

The categories are also known as labels or classes in Machine Learning.
As, the number of classes in this model are more than two it is not a binary classifier but a multiclass classifier.

The NLTK library stands for Natural Language Toolkit and it is used for performing various tasks for preprocessing of text data like: lemmatization, tokenization, removing stopwords and stemming, etc.
It is a library used for Natural Language Processing.

In this notebook I have used five different classification algorithms and seen how each of them works on this given dataset by comparing there accuracies. The dataset contains two files one for training and the other for testing. The training set consists of 1,20,000 news articles. I have used 50% of the data for training. Also it can be seen that the dataset is balanced which means it contains equal proportions of all classes in the dataset.

The classification algorithms used are:-


1 - Multinomial Naive Bayes

2 - Gaussian Naive Bayes

3 - Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier

4 - Light Gradient Boosting Machine Classifier


I have used Python's matplotlib and Seaborn library for plotting graphs and data visualization.
